This repository contains code necessary to reproduce figures and analyses presented in Bellis *et al.* (2022).

- **Fig1_mapxPCoA** contains code and accessory data files to run PCoA, produce map of sequenced samples, and evaluate IBD.  
- **Fig2_germination** contains code and data sheet to for analysis of germination rate data.  
- **Fig3_ANGSD** contains code and data (in `angsd_output` directory) for visualizing allele frequency differencies and expression of the chemocyanin across *S. hermonthica* developmental stages and also to visualize genome-wide patterns of Tajima's D and FST between finger millet-parasitizing and maize-parasitizing individuals of *S. hermonthica* sampled in Homa Bay, Kenya according based on alignments to the *de novo* assembled reference.  
- **kmer-dist** contains code, summary tables, and lists of differentiated k-mers (with GST >0.5) as well as other code needed for kmer-based analyses.
